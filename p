Cardholders earn 2 MyCruise points per $1 spent on qualifying purchases with Royal Caribbean and its sister brands and 1 MyCruise point per $1 spent on all other purchases. The value of the points do not exceed one cent, but are close and sometimes exactly one cent. This is a relatively good rewards rate. For example, the rewards redemption guide explains that 40,000 MyCruise Points get you an upgrade on a  7 to 8 night Celebrity Cruises Caribbean sailing for two (veranda to minimum available Concierge Class stateroom), and that the value of upgrade may not exceed four hundred dollars ($400 USD value). On the 8 Night Eastern Caribbean & The Bahamas cruise we evaluated, we found that the veranda base cost was $1699 per person, whereas the Concierge Class base cost was $1999 per person. This put the upgrade value at $300 and the point redemption at $300 / 40000 = $.0075 per point. Some of the redemptions are more straightforward and as mentioned above have a value of exactly one cent per point, for example a $1,000 discount off any Celebrity Cruises ship itinerary is available for 100,000 points. That's one cent per point. If you cruise with a guest a few times a year on Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, or Azamara cruises and use your Royal Caribbean® Visa Signature® to book the tickets, you would earn: $1699 ticket price x 2 travelers x 3 cruises x 2 points rewards rate = 20,388 points. Add in the 10,000 point signup bonus and you're up to 30,388 points or about $300 of value. Not bad, but you can't convert MyCruise points to cash back or statement credit, so unless you like being encouraged to spend more on cruise vacations by accumulating points with Royal Caribbean, our evaluation would recommend you get other cards that get you flat-rate 2% cash back on all purchases like the Citi Double Cash or Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature, or a travel rewards card with a higher than 2x rewards rate that you can use to book your cruises and than redeem for travel like airfare, car rentals, or for statement credit or cash back. That said, for people who are loyal to Royal Caribbean and like the idea of redemptions for free upgrades - did we mention charitable donations as well? - this is a solid no annual fee card that could be a great fit.",

There is a 25% bonus on any cash back rewards earned from your top two purchase categories each month, bringing the cash back rate to 1.56%. Categories are determined by Merchant Classification Codes, MCC, and the benefit is for the for the top two MCCs. Utilities, rent, a mortgage, or an auto loan, are big monthly costs, but if they charge fees on credit card transactions, which they typically do, it's not recommended to regularly pay them with a credit card unless it is for a valuable sign up bonus. As an example of the value of Sallie Mae Evolve's 25% bonus, in other words 1.56% cash back bonus rate, let's say the categories where you spent the most were gas, $150/month, and groceries, $400/month, and you spent the same amount each month for two years. Over the course of two years you would have earned 1.56% x 24 months x $550 = $205.92, over $200 from gas and grocery purchases. That's solid. However, even better would be if you had a cash back card that gets 2% cash back across all purchases, which the Citi Double Cash gets, because you would have earned: 2% x 24 months x $550 = $264, an extra $58 and change by having the higher rewards rate Citi Double Cash. And that's only looking at gas and grocery purchases. Let's say you spent $550 in other categories, not counting gas and groceries, each month, after 2 years you would earn 1.25% x 6 months x $550 = $165 from the rest of your spending. Thats $165 + $205.92 = $370.92 cash back from using Sallie Mae Evolve for two years. The benefit of high flat-rate cash back is clear though. If you used Citi Double Cash for those two years with it's unlimited 2% flat-rate cash back on your $550 + $550 = $1100 monthly spend, you would get 2% x 24 months x $1100 = $528 in cash back.

In other words, for every hundred dollars you spend on Southwest Airlines, you earn $4.50 in credit for future flights. This is almost like having a 5% off coupon for every Southwest flight. You also get four upgraded boardings per year when available that allow you to upgrade to A1-A15. A is the boarding group and 1-15 is the boarding position. For example, A1 boards before A15.

If you don't have another card that has provided you this as a benefit already, this is a great opportunity to sign up and save some time going through security, and in the case of Global Entry, U.S. customs. Generally, business cards are less valuable than personal cards, because they have higher annual fees and fewer perks, but Southwest Rapid Rewards® Performance Business earns 3 points for every $1 you spend on Southwest Airlines® purchases, and given that Southwest Airlines points are worth about 1.5 cents, that's a 3 x .015 = 4.5% rewards rate. In other words, for every hundred dollars you spend on Southwest Airlines, you earn $4.50 in credit for future flights. This is almost like having a 5% off coupon for every Southwest flight. You also get four upgraded boardings per year when available that allow you to upgrade to A1-A15. A is the boarding group and 1-15 is the boarding position. For example, A1 boards before A15. With the sign up bonus alone being worth 70,000 x $0.015 = $1050, this $199 annual fee card makes financial sense.",

			"bottom line": "Solid card for Spirit travelers. Cardholders earn two miles per dollar on every purchase. This is not a high rewards rate but great that it applies to all purchases, which is unusual for an airline card. Usually a 2X rewards rate for an airline card would only apply to purchases with the airline. The challenge with the Spirit Airlines World MasterCard® is the $59 annual fee after the first year. Other cards have no annual fee, like the Citi Double Cash, and give the exact same rewards rate, but allow you to get cash back. With this in mind, the only people who should look at Spirit Airlines World MasterCard® seriously are people who fly Spirit and enjoy hunting for deals. As an example, we evaluated the point value of a one-way trip from LAX to LGA and found the cost for an trip in early November, during an off-peak period, to be $200. If this flight were an off-peak flight, it would cost 7,500 points for a Spirit Airlines World MasterCard® customer. The point value would then be: $200 / 7,500 = more than two cents per point. This was the first flight we searched, and two cents per point is high. Because Spirit is not in an airline alliance, nor does it have point transfer partners, the miles you earn must be used for Spirit flights. So if you fly Spirit Airlines a few times a year, you will save money with the Spirit Airlines World MasterCard® by redeeming points on off-peak dates as noted above, even when you take into account Spirit Airlines's fees on reward tickets requested less than 21 days from departure: $50 between 7 and 20 days prior to departure and $75 6 days or less prior to departure. The signup bonus of 15,000 bonus miles after your first purchase + 15,000 bonus miles after making at least $500 in purchases within 90 days is valuable for these travelers as well. Even at a conservative one cent per point, the bonus is worth 30,000 x $0.01 = $300 in Spirit airfare, more than covering the $59 annual fee for several years. But keep in mind that using this card as your everyday spend card to earn miles comes at a cost. You could get the exact same rewards value, 2% or 2 cents per $1, with the Citi Double Cash, but you would be getting cash instead of miles confined to one airline.",

That's 1 Star per $1 when digitally loading your Starbucks Card with your Starbucks Rewards Visa Card plus 2 Stars per $1 spent when that Starbucks Card is used to pay at Starbucks. To get $50 of value or more to cover the annual fee you would have to earn $50 / $5 = 10 free drinks x 150 stars = 1500 stars. You could earn 1500 stars by spending 1500 stars / 3 stars per $1 = $500 annually on $500 / $5 = 100 custom drinks.

			"our take": "For Starbucks Regulars",
			"why get": "Starbucks Rewards Visa is a solid card for Starbucks fans. You will earn stars and 50 stars can be redeemed for a Brewed hot coffee, bakery item or hot tea and 150 can be redeemed for a custom drink, hot breakfast or parfait. You earn 6,500 Bonus Stars after you spend $500 using your Starbucks® Rewards Visa® Credit Card anywhere in the first 3 months. That's 6500 / 150 = more than 43 custom drinks. If you value a drink at $5, that's more than $200 of value, and a single star is worth $5 / 150 = more than three cents. That's great the first year, but there's a $49 annual fee. If you really like Starbucks, this is a great card for you, you just have to buy 100 drinks for it to make financial sense. For example, let's assume you earn the full 3 stars per $1 when you go to Starbucks and use this card. That's 1 Star per $1 when digitally loading your Starbucks Card with your Starbucks Rewards Visa Card plus 2 Stars per $1 spent when that Starbucks Card is used to pay at Starbucks. To get $50 of value or more to cover the annual fee you would have to earn $50 / $5 = 10 free drinks x 150 stars = 1500 stars. You could earn 1500 stars by spending 1500 stars / 3 stars per $1 = $500 annually on $500 / $5 = 100 custom drinks. Of course, it's not always about the payoff, sometimes there are side perks, like getting Barista Picks recommended for you by being a cardholder. In either case, this is a great card for people who go to Starbucks a few times a week or enjoy getting recommendations from Baristas.",

			"bottom line": "Great card for people looking to transfer and pay down debt over 3 years. Cardholders get a 3 year introductory offer at the Prime Rate(currently 5.00% variable APR) on balance transfers made in the first 60 days after account opening. Importantly, there is no balance transfer fee when you transfer a balance during the first 60 days your account is open. It's unusual for cards to offer no balance transfer fee, and very unusual to find no fee and 0% interest on balance transfers for 15 months. One option is Chase Slate, which has no balance transfer fee for transfers in the first 60 days and 0% Intro APR for 15 months on transfers in the first 60 days. However, say you have $10,000 of credit card debt accumulating a variable 25% interest APR on another card or combined between cards that have 30-day billing cycles. That 25% APR works out to a 0.25 / 365 = 0.068% daily periodic rate. If the average daily balance you've carried is $10,000, then the interest you accrued in one day is $10,000 x .00068 = $6.80. Over 30 days you will owe 30 x $6.80 = $205 in interest. If you are only able to make a monthly payment of $250 on that debt, then you will have $10,000 - $45 = $9,935 as your daily balance the next month. In this scenario, you will spend thousands of dollars on interest if you don't move the debt. The challenge is that you will not be able to pay off your credit card in 15 months, even with a 0% for 15 month balance transfer offer. So the Chase Slate offer could be harmful, because the interest rate increases again after 15 months. However, if you transferred the debt to SunTrust Prime Rewards, you would have 36 months to pay it off. You'd have to pay a little bit of interest, but if you assume the prime rate is 5%, the first month's interest would only come to 0.05 / 365 = 0.0001 x $10000 x 30 = $41.

Keep in mind it can take 2 to 4 weeks to process a balance transfer request, during which your balance will still be accumulating interest payable to its current bank. TD Cash has a 3% balance transfer fee, which is an average fee for most cards. By comparison, the Chase Slate has no balance transfer fee for transfers in the first 60 days, but on the other hand it doesn't offer any rewards or signup bonus. Cardholders earn 3% Cash Back on dining, from casual to fine dining and everything in between, 2% at grocery stores, and 1% on all other eligible purchases. The example TD gives on their website exemplifies the cash back rate perfectly: it you spend $2000 a month, that's $500 on dining, $500 on grocery stores, and $1,000 on all other eligible purchases you would earn 0.03 x 12 x 500 = $180 for dining, 0.02 x 12 x 500 = $120 for grocery stores and 0.01 x 12 x 1000 = $120 on all other spending. That's $420 in cash back. Add the $200 signup bonus and you are up to $620. This is an excellent cash back offer. If you're really on the fence though, consider this: if you got the Citi Double Cash with unlimited 2% cash back, you'd get $480 in value the first year. That's less than $620 from TD Cash. After the signup bonus no longer plays a part though, Citi Double Cash would in fact be more valuable because $480 is more than TD Cash's $420 in cash back, neglecting the sign up bonus. Compared to another popular card, Discover it® Cash Back, TD Cash would be worth less in year one by far, because of Discover's cash back match, but in year two TD Cash would be worth about the same for most people, because althouth Discover it® Cash Back has 5% cash back categories, it takes a little more effort to manage rotating categories each quarter and you'd have to spend wisely to substantially beat $420 in value. For example, using the spend above of $500 per month on dining, $500 per month on groceries and $500 in other categories, that would be $1500 of spend on dining per quarter spent during the 5% grocery category quarter and that would be $1500 on groceries per quarter spent during the grocery category quarter, earning you .05 x $3000 = $150. With unlimited 1% cash back the rest of the year on dining and groceries expenses when they are not the selected 5% cashback category and also including the 1% cash back on the $1000 monthly of other expenses, you would earn .01 x 12 x $1000 = $120 on your other expenses and .01 x 9 x $1000 = $90 on your dining and grocery purchases in addition to their $150 of 5% cash back earnings. That's a total of $360 before the cash back match, which would make it $720. Now, to beat out TD Cash in year two with the Discover it® Cash Back, you would just have to make sure you got $60 more value by making certain some of your 1% cash back purchases are in another 5% cash back category of purchases approved by Discover. It's not hard to fit into these remaining categories. Another category besides dining and groceries on Discover's website is purchases at Amazon.com, Target & Walmart.com. To be exact, if you were to spend $1500 at, in this example 5% category, Amazon.com, Target & Walmart.com, you would get be utilizing the 5% cash back category enough to bring the value up to $420, exactly equal to TD Cash.

Cardholders earn 3X First Class miles on travel and dining purchases, including flights, hotels, car rentals, cruises and dining and 1X First Class miles on all other purchases. On sign up, you get 25,000 bonus miles, equal to a $250 statement credit towards travel or dining purchases. Each Mile is worth at least one cent when redeemed for Cash Back, gift cards or travel. However, there is not a travel portal or opportunity to redeem miles for great deals on trips. Miles can be redeemed once you have already booked a trip elsewhere. For cash back, the redemption is exactly one cent. With this in mind, you would need to earn $89 x 100 = 8900 Miles to make up for the $89 annual fee. That's 8900 Miles / 3 = $2967 in purchases earned on the 3X Mile reward tier of travel and dining purchases. For example, that could be 12 months of $150/month dining expenses, plus two $500 round trip tickets across the country plus two 1-day $90 car rentals for $1800 + $1000 + $180 = $2980. If you think you'll spend more at grocery stores than on travel, consider TD Cash, which earns 2% cash back at grocery stores. TD First Class℠ Visa Signature® only earns 1X Miles on grocery stores, which convert to 1% cash back. If you won't be traveling much and especially if you spend more on shopping, also consider the value you could get with a non-TD cash back card, like Chase Freedom or Discover it® Cash Back. With either of these cards you get 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined purchases in bonus categories each quarter you activate and unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. Chase Freedom has a department store category while Discover it® Cash Back has an online retailer category specifically for Amazon.com, Target, and Walmart.com. It's not easy to hit the maximum $1500 each quarter in the 5% cash back category, especially when it's gas, but if you spent half the maximum each quarter you would earn .05 x $750 x 4 = $150.

No balance transfer fee is very attractive, and rare. Note that there have been reports from consumers that the credit limit granted is low, typically $5000 or $1000. This is important, because that will be the maximum amount you could transfer onto this card. On top of transferring all or even just part of your credit card debt, Amex EveryDay® is also a solid rewards card for people who use a credit card to buy groceries. Cardholders earn 2x points at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases. If you hit the $6,000 limit in grocery purchases, you will have earned 12,000 points, worth about $120. $120 from maxing out the high rewards category is not great, but earning 2X rewards on top of no balance transfer fee is virtually unheard of. You do earn 20% extra Membership Rewards points if you use your card 20 times in a billing period, which is a nice perk. Another nice benefit with Amex EveryDay® is that the points transfer at a 1:1 ratio to most American Express Membership Rewards partner airlines, including Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta, Etihad Airways, and more than 5 more. Not every rewards program grants a 1:1 ratio on so many travel partners, but Amex Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards do. Cardholders also get a nice hotel perk through the Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts (FHR) program, in which you can book Hyatt reservations for significantly more than one cent per point.

This means if you book a qualifying hotel rate on amextravel.com and pay for it, and then find the same room in the same hotel, for the same dates and for the same number of children and adults at a lower price online, they will refund you the difference. Note that there have been reports from consumers that it's important to make sure you get credit by getting a screenshot of the amextravel.com price and the lower price at the same time. Amex members also earn an additional Membership Rewards point, for a 2X total rewards rate, when you book travel at amextravel.com. Unfortunately, you cannot redeem rewards for statement credit in the traditional sense, instead you pay for eligible purchases with rewards, and you get 0.6 cents per point. Nonetheless, using points on amextravel.com for 1 cent per point or transferring to airline partners to get about 1 cent per point on partner airfare makes Amex EveryDay® a reasonably good travel card. If you are looking to pay off debt and also would put your grocery expenses on this card, Amex EveryDay® is a great card for you.",

The annual fee is $95 with Amex EveryDay® Preferred and $0 for Amex EveryDay®, and the difference comes in the rewards rate. Amex EveryDay® earns 2X rewards on supermarkets and 1X on other purchases and has a 20% bonus on Membership Rewards points if you use your card 20 times in a billing period. If you use your card a lot, you'll want to go for the Preferred. Amex EveryDay® Preferred not only earns 3X on supermarkets and 2X on gas, as mentioned, but it also earns 50% extra Membership Rewards points if you use your card 30 times in a billing period. This increases your rewards rate significantly to 4X Points on supermarkets and 3X points on gas. Another nice benefit you get with Amex EveryDay® Preferred is that the points transfer at a 1:1 ratio to most American Express Membership Rewards partner airlines, including Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta, Etihad Airways, and more than 5 more. Not every rewards program grants a 1:1 ratio on so many travel partners, but Amex Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards do.

If you don't think you'll spend ($400 + $100 + $50) x 12 = $6600 per year, you will definitely want to opt for a no annual fee card.

			"bottom line": "Great card for travelers who stay at IHG hotels. IHG hotels include Holiday Inn, Candlewood Suites, Crowne Plaza, Kimpton, and InterContinental hotels. The sign up bonus is 80,000 Bonus Points after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening - that's worth about 1 hotel stay. You also get a fourth reward night free when you redeem points for any stay of 4 or more nights. With the $89 annual fee, you also get an anniversary night at one of IHG®'s eligible Hotels & Resorts worldwide, every year, Global Entry or TSA Pre✓® Fee Credit, and 10,000 bonus points after you spend $20,000 on purchases and make one additional purchase each account anniversary year. The anniversary night alone will cover the annual fee. While you can redeem points for airfare, in most cases you will get 1 mile for every 5 points, so it's not a good decision, unless the points are worth one fifth of a cent. To find the value of IHG points, we found that a 1 King Bed Superior With Balcony room at the InterContinental: Los Angeles Century City hotel was available for $284 or 65,000 points. In this case, the points would be worth 0.4 cents per dollar. At 0.4 cents per point, the Intro bonus of 80,000 points would be valued at $320. 0.4 cents per point is not a high rewards rate, but not terrible considering the annual fee is only $89 and you also receive Platinum Elite Status, which is signifantly more valuable than the IHG® Rewards Club Traveler's Gold status. While Gold status gets you a 10% point bonus on paid stays, Platinum Elite status gets you a 50% bonus on paid stays, which is alotted on top of the base points you get from this card, 10 points per $1; therefore, you are earning an extra 5 more points per $1, which when combined with your 10 points per $1 for being an IHG® Rewards Club Member, gets you 25 points per $1. It's not the simplest reward structure, and you will need to purchase a lot of stays in order to get benefit. For example, if you booked two 5-night stays at the hotel above or a hotel with the same value over the course of the year with IHG® Rewards Club Premier, you would earn 25 x 2 nights x 5 stays x $284 x $0.004 dollars per point = $284: that's 1 free night. With that said, IHG does offer a program called PointBreaks, allowing cardholders to book two one-night stays for as little as 5,000 points each. The IHG website breaks the eligible hotels into 5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 point redemptions. Even the 15,000 point redemption give you an improved point value and that's even if you consider the value of a one-night stay at 15,000 point hotels to be the same as standard hotels, let's say $100. PointBreaks is worth your time. If you stay at IHG hotels, and especially if you use PointBreaks, IHG® Rewards Club Premier is a card you will want to get for the signup bonus and the annual free anniversary night, even with the $89 annual fee.",

			"bottom line": "Great card for JetBlue business travelers. Cardholders earn 50,000 points after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days and earn 10,000 points when a purchase is made on an employee card in the first 90 days. To find out how much 60,000 points is worth, we looked at the price of a roundtrip flight from ORD Chicago O'Hare to MCO Orlando International Airport departing on Christmas and returning on New Year's Day booked two months in advance. The cost would be 106,200 points or $1108, valuing the points on one cent apiece and making the 60,000 signup bonus worth $600 in JetBlue travel. Now to find out if the card is worth renewing for $99, let's assume you travel six times a year on flights having the same value as the example, $1108 and you don't use this card for any other purchases. If you use points to book three of those six flights, which won't earn you more points, and use JetBlue Business Card to book the three other flights, your three flights booked with JetBlue Business Card would earn you $550 in JetBlue travel. If you add the 5,000 bonus points every year after your account anniversary, which is worth $50 as long as you use it, you have $600 in JetBlue travel. This is enough for a one-way ticket portion of the $1108 flight example we have been using from Chicago to Orlando. On this flight, the one-way tickets cost the same as for the rountrip, so you could book one flight with points and the other with your JetBlue Business Card and you will have successfully redeemed $600 in JetBlue travel, more than paying for the $99 annual fee. One-way tickets are typically a little more expensive if they are premium tickets typically purchased by business travelers, but less expensive for discount airlines. What this means for you is that if you are set on flying in first class or business class, which is called Mint on JetBlue, you may have to earn more points to make sure you have enough for the flight you want. Note that when you book a JetBlue flight, three popular options for the regular class seating are the Blue fare, Blue Plus Fare, or Blue Flex fare. The item that might make the biggest difference in choosing between the options is checked bags. Checked bags are typically $30 for the first bag and $40 for the second bag. The Blue fare doesn't include checked bags, while the Blue Plus fare includes one free checked bag and costs about $15 more than the Blue fare, which makes it a financial sensible option. The Blue Flex fare includes two free checked bags and costs about $100 more than a Blue fare. $100 is more than just paying for the checked bags would cost, but you also get no change fees and free same-day changes. Change fees are relatively complicated, because they increase with flight price. For example, the lowest tier, for fares up to $99, has change fees which are $75 for Plus and Blue. The highest tier, for fares $200 or more, has change fees which are $200. Same-day changes cost $75, but again on Blue Flex they are free. While the normal rate is 6X points on JetBlue purchases, Blue Plus earns you 7X and Blue Flex earn 8x. You also get 300 points for every JetPaws fee, the JetBlue program to bring your pet to your destination with you, which is $125 each way. After spending $50,000 or more on purchases each calendar year, you earn Mosaic benefits, which include a free first and second checked bag, no change and cancellation fees for anyone on the itinerary, early boarding, an expedited security checkpoint line, and complimentary alcoholic beverages onboard. If you fly JetBlue regularly for business, this is a great card for you.",

			"our take": "Purchase Six JetBlue Flights, Nothing Else, and Still Worth It",
			"why get": "JetBlue Business Card is a great card for JetBlue business travelers. Cardholders earn 50,000 points after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days and earn 10,000 points when a purchase is made on an employee card in the first 90 days. To find out how much 60,000 points is worth, we looked at the price of a roundtrip flight from ORD Chicago O'Hare to MCO Orlando International Airport departing on Christmas and returning on New Year's Day booked two months in advance. The cost would be 106,200 points or $1108, valuing the points on one cent apiece and making the 60,000 signup bonus worth $600 in JetBlue travel. Now to find out if the card is worth renewing for $99, let's assume you travel six times a year on flights having the same value as the example, $1108 and you don't use this card for any other purchases. If you use points to book three of those six flights, which won't earn you more points, and use JetBlue Business Card to book the three other flights, your three flights booked with JetBlue Business Card would earn you $550 in JetBlue travel. If you add the 5,000 bonus points every year after your account anniversary, which is worth $50 as long as you use it, you have $600 in JetBlue travel. This is enough for a one-way ticket portion of the $1108 flight example we have been using from Chicago to Orlando. On this flight, the one-way tickets cost the same as for the rountrip, so you could book one flight with points and the other with your JetBlue Business Card and you will have successfully redeemed $600 in JetBlue travel, more than paying for the $99 annual fee. One-way tickets are typically a little more expensive if they are premium tickets typically purchased by business travelers, but less expensive for discount airlines. What this means for you is that if you are set on flying in first class or business class, which is called Mint on JetBlue, you may have to earn more points to make sure you have enough for the flight you want. Note that when you book a JetBlue flight, three popular options for the regular class seating are the Blue fare, Blue Plus Fare, or Blue Flex fare. The item that might make the biggest difference in choosing between the options is checked bags. Checked bags are typically $30 for the first bag and $40 for the second bag. The Blue fare doesn't include checked bags, while the Blue Plus fare includes one free checked bag and costs about $15 more than the Blue fare, which makes it a financial sensible option. The Blue Flex fare includes two free checked bags and costs about $100 more than a Blue fare. $100 is more than just paying for the checked bags would cost, but you also get no change fees and free same-day changes. Change fees are relatively complicated, because they increase with flight price. For example, the lowest tier, for fares up to $99, has change fees which are $75 for Plus and Blue. The highest tier, for fares $200 or more, has change fees which are $200. Same-day changes cost $75, but again on Blue Flex they are free. While the normal rate is 6X points on JetBlue purchases, Blue Plus earns you 7X and Blue Flex earn 8x. You also get 300 points for every JetPaws fee, the JetBlue program to bring your pet to your destination with you, which is $125 each way. After spending $50,000 or more on purchases each calendar year, you earn Mosaic benefits, which include a free first and second checked bag, no change and cancellation fees for anyone on the itinerary, early boarding, an expedited security checkpoint line, and complimentary alcoholic beverages onboard. If you fly JetBlue regularly for business, this is a great card for you.",

You get Points Pooling with TrueBlue points as well, which allows you and up to 7 friends and family members to combine points to earn awards faster with no point transfer fee. One thing that is particular to JetBlue among airlines is that you can't transfer JetBlue points to any other airlines, but you can redeem them on Hawaiian Airlines. Besides JetBlue flights, you can earn points by the mile flown by adding your TrueBlue number during the booking process on Hawaiian Airlines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Icelandair, JSX, Silver Airways, Singapore Airlines, and South African Airways. Most partners offer earnings starting at 1 Point / 2 miles flown and different seating areas have different rewards. If you're in frequent flyer programs with any of these other airlines, check the value of your ticket before you make the TrueBlue purchase to make sure it's worth it to book with TrueBlue, because you can only earn rewards from one program for your flight. If you rarely fly JetBlue but are interested in JetBlue Plus to get started, consider that JetBlue tied with Southwest Airlines for the top plcae in customer satisfaction among North American low-cost carriers, according to JD Power. Even if you don't fly JetBlue regularly, if you fly JetBlue at all and get $100 of value on waived checked bag fees, flight redemptions, or through pooling JetBlue points, this is a great card for you.",

If you don't regularly buy at least a few of those brands, this card may be less valuable for you. Cardholders also get 2 points per dollar at the Kroger Family of Companies (excluding fuel centers), which includes Kroger Marketplace, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, King Soopers, Dillons, Smith's Food & Drug Stores, Smith's Marketplace, Fry's Food and Drug Store, Fry's Marketplace, QFC - Quality Food Centers, City Market, Baker's, Owen's, JayC Food Stores, Gerbes, Pay Less Super Markets, Food4Less (So CA, NV, IN and IL stores only), Foods Co, Fred Meyer Jewelers, Littman Jewelers, Barclay Jewelers, and Kroger. Cardholders also get an additional 25¢ off per gallon for one year each time you redeem at least 100 fuel points at participating Kroger Family of Companies Fuel Centers. To earn fuel points, you buy groceries with your Kroger 1-2-3 REWARDS® World Mastercard® and earn 1 point per dollar. If you bought $100 of groceries, you would earn the 25 cent discount for one year. Note fuel points do not count towards rewards points, and you would not receive another 25 cents off that already discounted price for redeeming more fuel points. The Kroger points rewards are issued as Rewards Certificates that can be redeemed at the Kroger Family of Companies, not including Kroger fuel centers. The points are worth one half cent per dollar. Note that the average credit card point is worth one cent per dollar. Rewards Certificates can not be used to purchase alcohol, cigarettes, tobacco or prescription products. The rewards rate is only 3 points per $1 x one half cent per point = 1.5%, and strictly from a financial perspective you would be better off with a flat-rate cash back card that gives you unlimited cash back on all purchases. For example, Citi Double Cash gives you 2% cash back on anything, not just Kroger products: 1% when you buy, plus 1% as you pay the balance. If you don't spend that much at Kroger, you can do even better on groceries and gas specifically with Bank of America® Cash Rewards, which gets you 3% cash back on gas and 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs up to $2,500 in combined purchases each quarter, followed by 1% cash back on everything else.

			"bottom line": "Solid card for premium U.S. Bank customers looking to travel. Note that cardholders must be an existing U.S. Bank customer. The enrollment bonus of 50,000 points, which is worth $750 in travel, makes the points valued at 1.5 cents. For a $400 annual fee, the card offers 3X points per $1 on travel and 3X points per $1 on mobile wallet spending. With increasing adoption of Apple Pay, Google Pay, Microsoft Pay, or Samsung Pay, U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® is essentially offering $0.015 dollars per point x 3 points per $1 = 4.5% travel rewards for all transactions that accept your mobile wallet payment provider. This is unmatched. Just looking at perks, the statement credit of up to $325 for eligible travel purchases and $100 TSA Pre® or Global Entry statement credit make up for the annual fee if you use them. Note that although U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite does get you 12-month Priority Pass™ Select membership to more than 1,200 VIP lounges worldwide, it only provides you with 4 passes, good for 4 visits for you and one guest. After that lounge visits cost $27. Also, unfortunately there have been reports from consumers that U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® does not have the easiest redemption app. At restaurants, using mobile wallet can be a problem. Other premium travel cards, like Chase Sapphire Reserve, offer a higher than 1X rewards rate on dining and are more valuable in this case. Another item to consider is that the rewards program is separate from the U.S. Bank FlexPoints rewards, so information you read about FlexPoints reward redemption and travel partners will not apply here. If you're a U.S. bank customer and you are interested in earning rewards at a valuable rate that can be redeemed for travel through U.S. Bank, Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® is a solid card for you.",

			"our take": "High Travel Rewards from Mobile Wallet and Travel Purchases",
			"why get": "U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® Card is a solid card for premium U.S. Bank customers who travel frequently. Note that cardholders must be an existing U.S. Bank customer. The enrollment bonus of 50,000 points, which is worth $750 in travel, makes the points valued at 1.5 cents. For a $400 annual fee, the card offers 3X points per $1 on travel and 3X points per $1 on mobile wallet spending. With increasing adoption of Apple Pay, Google Pay, Microsoft Pay, or Samsung Pay, U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® is essentially offering $0.015 dollars per point x 3 points per $1 = 4.5% travel rewards for all transactions that accept your mobile wallet payment provider. This is unmatched. Just looking at perks, the statement credit of up to $325 for eligible travel purchases and $100 TSA Pre® or Global Entry statement credit make up for the annual fee if you use them. Note that although U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite does get you 12-month Priority Pass™ Select membership to more than 1,200 VIP lounges worldwide, it only provides you with 4 passes, good for 4 visits for you and one guest. After that lounge visits cost $27. Also, unfortunately there have been reports from consumers that U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® does not have the easiest redemption app. At restaurants, using mobile wallet can be a problem. Other premium travel cards, like Chase Sapphire Reserve, offer a higher than 1X rewards rate on dining and are more valuable in this case. Another item to consider is that the rewards program is separate from the U.S. Bank FlexPoints rewards, so information you read about FlexPoints reward redemption and travel partners will not apply here. If you're a U.S. bank customer and you are interested in earning rewards at a valuable rate that can be redeemed for travel through U.S. Bank, Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® is a solid card for you.",

Cardholders earn $500 cash back after you spend $4,500 in eligible net purchases on the Account Owner's card in the first 150 days. This means employee cards don't count. On an ongoing basis, you earn 3% cash back at eligible gas stations, office supply stores and cell phone/service providers and 1% cash back on everything else. It's possible U.S. Bank has experienced what would be called misuse of the card on gas purchases, as there is a note stating that single transaction purchases of gasoline in excess of $200 will not be deemed to be a purchase of automobile gasoline and as such will earn a reward of 1%. There have also been reports from consumers expressing discontent at the application process and the credit limit extended to them. U.S. Bank has won the World's Most Ethical Companies Award by the Ethisphere Institute, a for-profit company that defines and measures corporate ethical standards, for the past five years.

			"bottom line": "Solid card for people who like to choose and get rotating cash back categories. Cardholders earn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined eligible net purchases each quarter on two categories you choose. If you spend over $2000 per month in the 5% categories, you will be better off with a flat rate unlimited cash back card like Citi Double Cash, which earns unlimited 2% cash back. This is becasue after you hit the $2,000 quarterly limit, you earn only 1% cash back. That said, the quarterly bonus of $2,000 is $500 higher than other 5% rotating category cards, such as Discover it® Cash Back, Discover it® Student Cash Back, NHL® Discover it®, or Chase Freedom®, but there is one drawback to U.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature®. U.S. Bank chooses the categories that are available to you, so even though you choose two categories each category, they may not be as valuable as you'd like. Take for instance gas stations, grocery stores or restaurants: each of these everyday categories is not available to choose becuase they automatically fall in the 2% category. Two of the most popular 5% cash back category cards, Discover it® Cash Back and Chase Freedom® both have a grocery store quarter and a gas station quarter. Discover also offers a restaurants quarter. Consumers also reported that some categories they liked were removed from U.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature®; for example, the category for bookstores, which included Amazon, the category for car rentals, and the category for charities are no longer available. It's important to also note that if you don't pick categories for a quarter, you get 1% cash back. And you cannot pick or change a category five or fewer days before the quarter begins, so if you anticipate a change in your spending right before the deadline, it may be too late. It's not accurate to say U.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature® will not be valuable to you; especially if you're a U.S. Bank customer, you can get your cash back deposited directly into your bank account. Additionally, it's only fair to say there are some challenges with cash back categories that are common to all rotating cash back cards, such as merchant classification problems; for example, in the case of U.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature®, a consumer reported not getting cash back on a furniture purchase, one of the 5% category options on U.S. Bank's website, because it was classified as home furnishings and therefore missing out on cash back. The U.S. Bank website shows over 2500, 5 star, written reviews just on this card, so it is well loved by both U.S. Bank and non-U.S. Bank customers.

			"bottom line": "Great card for people who want to book airfare directly with the rewards program where they earned the points and to earn travel rewards on their cell phone bill, donations to charity, and either airfare, gas stations or grocery. Cardholders earn 2 FlexPoints on qualifying charitable donations and most cell phone service providers, and 2 FlexPoints on airfare, gas stations or grocery purchases, whichever of the three has the greatest amount in total purchases. The signup bonus of 25000 FlexPoints is worth $375 in travel, hotel stays, car rentals, and more. FlexPoints have a fixed value of 1.5 cents per point and can be redeemed for travel rewards with more than 150 airlines, thousands of hotels, car rentals, and cruise lines. With a $49 annual fee starting the second year, you could spend just $2000 across the 2X reward categories during the entire year and pay for the fee. As a more realistic example, if you spent $500 per month in 2X reward categories, $250 on phone bills and $250 on gas and groceries and another $500 on other expenses, you would earn $270 worth of travel. While you can redeem FlexPoints for cash back, they will not be worth as much. The FlexPoints rewards program also doesn't have any transfer partners, so you won't be able to transfer to try to increase their value. Another option you might consider is Capital One® Venture® Rewards, which earns 2 Miles per dollar on all purchases and has a $95 annual fee starting the second year. It has a signup bonus of 50,000 miles once you spend $3,000 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $500 in travel. As you can see from the signup bonus value, Capital One miles are worth only about one cent per mile; however, you can get higher value by transferring them to one of their 15 transfer parters, so if you're more hands-on when it comes to points, Capital One is the better option. Also keep in mind you would be earning 2 miles per $1 on all purchases. Another option is Chase Sapphire Preferred®, which has a $95 annual fee - not waived in year one - and earns 2X points on travel and dining. Earning 2X travel rewards on dining might be attractive to you. Chase Sapphire Preferred® also has a signup bonus of 60,000 one-time bonus points offer after you spend $4,000 on purchases within 3 months of account opening which is $750 in travel. This valuation takes into account the 25% bonus you get for redeeming Chase Ultimate Rewards for travel. Note there have been reports of U.S. Bank's FlexPerks rewards redemption website technology being outdated. According to consumers, this may have resulted in difficulty booking through the online portal and even point value decreases in their accounts. There are also more than 1300 5 star reviews on U.S. Bank's website for U.S. Bank FlexPerks® Travel Rewards Visa Signature®.
